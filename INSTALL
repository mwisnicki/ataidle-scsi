To install ATAidle, run 'make' to build it, followed by 'make install' to
install the binary into /usr/local/sbin and install the man page into
/usr/local/man/man8.   If you later want to remove ataidle, simply run
'make uninstall'.

Alternatively, the binary can be copied and run from a more convenient 
location.
